          Hello! My name is Mike and I am currently a Junior in the <a  target="_blank" class="content-link" href="http://raikes.unl.edu/">Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management</a> at the University of Nebraska&#8212Lincoln where I am studying computer science. Throughout my college career, I have had the opportunity to work on many exciting projects. Specifically, I created an Android health tracking application as part of my group's Software Engineering project.

          This summer, I am planning on beginning work on android tutorials aimed at beginners. Throughout my time learning android last semester, I found that there were very few easy to follow, in-depth tutorials. These tutorials will be designed to introduce the basics in relation to an actual application as apposed to the most basic use-case.
