                    <p>
                        <img src="../Images/ic_launcher.png" id="logo" class="image" align="left" />vocalize is an Android application I am currently working on. The goal of this project is to produce an application that allows for hands-free Spotify use. This will be
                        accomplished mostly through voice detection and hand gestures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the moment, I am in the process of finalizing the needed documentation for publication on the Play Store. It should be available for use within the next few weeks. I am also planning on open-sourcing the project soon as I do not believe it is viable to ask users to pay for money for this simple service. This has mostly been a fun project for me to design a cool app and mess around with APIs.

                        Below are a few screenshots of what is currently implemented in the app!

                    <h3>HealthTrac</h3>
                    <p>
                        HealthTrac was a project for my software engineering class. We created an android mobile application and an ASP.NET MVC 5 web dashboard/ API.
                        I was responsible for designing and creating the mobile application. The source for the project and screenshots of the mobile application can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ashlynlee13/HealthTrac" >here</a>.

                        The project required a variety of different technologies including route tracking, social networking, data analytics, and the use of a random forest for categorizing activities. This project was the most fun project I have worked on so far and it inspired me to start working on Music Voice.

                <h3>Assembler</h3>
                <p>
                    The assembler I wrote was for my Embedded Systems and Computer Organization class I took my sophomore year. The
                    assembler takes in an assembly file as input and converts it to a memory initialization file (.mif) which was used
                    as input for a processor. I made the assembler to make the job of initializing the memory of the processor easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was the first program I wrote in C# and I am sure there are many areas that could be improved to better utilize
                    features of the language. I have included it on this projects page because it demonstrates my problem solving ability.
                    The source code for the project can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mcasper3/ClassProject">here</a>.
