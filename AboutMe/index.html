                    Hello! My name is Mike and I am currently a Junior in the <a target="_blank" class="content-link" href="http://raikes.unl.edu/">Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management</a>
                    at the University of Nebraska&#8212Lincoln where I am studying computer science. Throughout my college career, I have had the opportunity to work on many exciting projects. Specifically,
                    I created an Android health tracking application as part of my group's Software Engineering project and I also created an assembler to convert an assembly file into a .mif.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy programming immensely, probably more than I should. When I am not developing, I enjoy playing almost any sport, working out, reading, and hanging out with friends. I am currently
                    trying to improve my German skills to hopefully become fluent in German by next Summer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the near future, I am planning on beginning work on android tutorials aimed at beginners. Throughout my time learning android last semester, I found that there were very few easy to
                    follow, in-depth tutorials. These tutorials will be designed to introduce the basics in relation to an actual application as apposed to the most basic use-case.
